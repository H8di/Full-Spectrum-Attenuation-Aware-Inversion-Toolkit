# Seismic Inversion & Rock Physics Tools (wide range of frequency)

## üéØ Research Focus

This repository supports my research in **Seismic Inversion**, **Elastic Tensor Analysis**, **Attenuation** and **Geomechanical Modeling** with a focus on subsurface characterization at wide range of scales. The codebase contributes to numerical simulations and inversion workflows involving:

- Effective Medium Theory and Rock Physics
- Elastic wave attenuation in isotropic & Anisotropic Media
- Eshelby-based inclusions and T-matrix formulation
- Green‚Äôs function computations and PDE-based modeling
- Finite Difference approximations for forward simulations

These tools allow building synthetic datasets, transforming stiffness tensors, analyzing wave response, attenuation, and validating inversion techniques. They provide a versatile foundation for custom seismic inversion in both isotropic and anisotropic geological settings.


This repository contains a subset of custom MATLAB tools developed for seismic inversion and rock physics modeling at differenr frequency range from core, well-logs, and seismic scale. The full set of modules involves elastic tensor manipulation, Green's functions, Eshelby inclusions, transformation matrices, T-Matrix Model, and inversion algorithms.
